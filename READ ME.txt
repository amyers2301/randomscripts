READ ME

No, really, read it.

The idea here is you, as ILT employees with appropriate access, can create and 
delete users for the INSIGHT DLP Secure FTP site. You should be able to run the
create.sh and remove.sh scripts which are symlinked from your home directory.

The results of which will be printed to stdout as well as saved to:
/etc/ftp/userList

This list is a running list of active FTP users. You'll see a symlink to the 
user list file from your home directory. If you created a FTP user
for someone and they have forgotten their username or password, it is stored
in that location. Please use that before removing the account and adding a 
new one.

Any questions, ask Aaron.

Thank you for reading me.
